# Elastic APM Cloud Native Buildpack

The buildpack installs the [elastic apm agent](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/java/current/index.html) in a jvm.

## Usage

To package this buildpack for consumption:

```
$ ./scripts/package.sh --version <version-number>
```

This will create a `buildpackage.cnb` file under the `build` directory which you
can use to build your app as follows:
`pack build <app-name> -p <path-to-app> -b build/buildpackage.cnb`

### Specifying a project path

To specify a project subdirectory to be used as the root of the app, please use
the `BP_NODE_PROJECT_PATH` environment variable at build time either directly
(ex. `pack build my-app --env BP_NODE_PROJECT_PATH=./src/my-app`) or through a
[`project.toml`
file](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/main/extensions/project-descriptor.md).
This could be useful if your app is a part of a monorepo.
